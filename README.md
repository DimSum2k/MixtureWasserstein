Project for the course "Computational Optimal Transport" of Gabriel Peyr√© at ENS Paris Saclay.

The report (in english) describes the article:

[Delon, Desolneux, *A Wasserstein-type distance in the space of Gaussian Mixture Models, 2019*](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02178204)

The notebooks present experiments using a transportation distance between GMM defined by restricting the set of possible coupling measures to Gaussian mixtures.
